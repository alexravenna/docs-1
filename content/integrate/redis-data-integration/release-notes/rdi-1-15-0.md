RDI's mission is to help Redis customers sync Redis Enterprise with live data from their slow disk-based databases to:

- Meet the required speed and scale of read queries and provide an excellent and predictable user experience.
- Save resources and time when building pipelines and coding data transformations.
- Reduce the total cost of ownership by saving money on expensive database read replicas.

RDI keeps the Redis cache up to date with changes in the primary database, using a [_Change Data Capture (CDC)_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Change_data_capture) mechanism.
It also lets you _transform_ the data from relational tables into convenient and fast data structures that match your app's requirements. You specify the transformations using a configuration system, so no coding is required.

## What's New in 1.15.0

{{<warning>}}
**Breaking change when using JSON with `json_update_strategy: merge`**

RDI now uses the native `JSON.MERGE` command instead of Lua scripts for JSON merge operations. While this provides significant performance improvements (2x faster), there is a **functional difference** in how null values are handled:

- **Previous behavior (Lua merge)**: When merging `{"field1": "value1", "field2": "value2"}` with `{"field2": null, "field3": "value3"}`, the result was `{"field1": "value1", "field2": null, "field3": "value3"}` (null value is preserved)
- **New behavior (JSON.MERGE)**: The same merge produces `{"field1": "value1", "field3": "value3"}` (null value removes the field, following [RFC 7396](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7396))

**Impact**: If your application logic distinguishes between a field with a `null` value and a missing field, you may need to adjust your data handling. This follows the JSON Merge Patch RFC standard but differs from the previous Lua implementation.

**Configuration**: You can control this behavior using the `use_native_json_merge` property in the processors section of your configuration. Set it to `false` to revert to the previous Lua-based merge behavior if needed.
{{</warning>}}

- **Native JSON merge for improved performance**: RDI now automatically uses the native `JSON.MERGE` command from RedisJSON 2.6.0+ instead of Lua scripts for JSON merge operations, providing 2x performance improvement. This feature is enabled by default and can be controlled via the `use_native_json_merge` property in the processors section of the configuration.
- **Support for sharded Redis databases**: RDI now supports writing to multi-sharded Redis Enterprise databases for the RDI database, resolving cross-slot violations when saving statistics.
- **Enhanced processor performance metrics**: Detailed performance metrics are now exposed through the metrics exporter and statistics endpoint, with separate tracking for transformation time and write time.
- **Resource management improvements**: Collector and processor pods now support configurable resource requests, limits, and node affinity/tolerations for better cluster resource utilization.

- **Leadership status monitoring**: New metrics expose leadership status and pipeline phase information for better monitoring of HA deployments.
- **Improved configuration validation**: More rigid validation for `config.yaml` and `jobs.yaml` files helps catch configuration errors earlier in the deployment process.
- **Custom K3s installation options**: The installer now supports passing custom arguments to K3s installation for more flexible on-premises deployments.
- **Workload Identity authentication**: Added support for Google Cloud Workload Identity authentication to Google Cloud Storage (GCS), eliminating the need for service account JSON files in many scenarios.
- Processor performance metrics showing transformation and write times separately
- Enhanced statistics endpoint with new metrics for transform and process time

### Bug Fixes and Stability Improvements

- **Fixed task reconciliation errors**: Resolved "The ID argument cannot be a complete ID because xadd-id-uniqueness-mode is strict" errors during task reconciliation.
- **Fixed Debezium unavailable values**: Addressed issues where `__debezium_unavailable_value` was appearing in Redis data.
- **Improved operator stability**: Disabled operator webhooks by default to simplify deployments and reduce potential issues.

### Documentation Improvements

- **Oracle XStream documentation**: Added documentation on how to prepare Oracle databases with XStream for RDI.
- **Flink collector documentation**: Added the `rdi-flink-collector` to the public documentation.
- **FAQ for common issues**: Created a comprehensive FAQ with common issues and error messages to help users troubleshoot problems more quickly.

## Limitations

RDI can write data to a Redis Active-Active database. However, it doesn't support writing data to two or more Active-Active replicas. Writing data from RDI to several Active-Active replicas could easily harm data integrity as RDI is not synchronous with the source database commits.
