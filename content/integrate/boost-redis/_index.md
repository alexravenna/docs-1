Connect your C++ application to a Redis database using the Boost.Redis client library built on Boost.Asio.

## Overview

Boost.Redis is a C++ client library for Redis built on top of Boost.Asio, providing asynchronous, high-performance Redis operations. It leverages modern C++ features and the proven Boost.Asio networking library for robust, scalable applications.

## Key Features

- **Asynchronous Operations**: Built on Boost.Asio for non-blocking, high-performance I/O
- **Modern C++**: Uses C++17 features for clean, efficient code
- **Type Safety**: Strong typing for Redis commands and responses
- **Coroutine Support**: C++20 coroutine integration for elegant async code
- **Connection Pooling**: Efficient connection management and reuse
- **Pipeline Support**: Command batching for improved throughput
- **SSL/TLS Support**: Secure connections with encryption
- **Cross-platform**: Works on all major operating systems

## Getting Started

Refer to the [Boost.Redis documentation](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/develop/libs/redis/doc/html/index.html) to install, connect, and use Boost.Redis.
